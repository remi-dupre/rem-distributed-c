Description of distributed REM algorithm
========================================

Edge request
------------
This is a request sent to a processor, asking it to run on its local tree, try to conclude, are send a new request to another processor.

### Context
 - **process**: current process id
 - **p(vertex)**: points to the parent of *vertex* in the disjoint-set structure
 - **owner(vertex)**: id of the process that was assigned this vertex
 - **local_root(vertex)**: classical find operation, with classical compression

### Inputs: 'task (r_x, r_y)'
 - **r_x**, **r_y**: current edges we compute on, we want to check if they are already in the same component
 - **(x, y)**: the edges that initialy started this request

It is important that theses task are communicated as a queue among processes, so that it two requests reach the same vertex, they are always executed in the same order.
If they do not propagate to the same process, this won't be a problem since one will be one communication phase ahead to the other.

### Assumptions
 - (a1) *owner(r_x) = process*

### Algorithm
```python
# Localy moves up
r_x <- local_root(r_x)

# Trying to move on the tree
if p(r_x) < r_y:
    if r_x == p(r_x):
        p(r_x) <- p(r_y)
        mark (x, y)
    else:
        z <- p(r_x)
        p(r_x) <- r_y
        send the task (z, r_y) to owner(z)
else if p(r_x) > r_y:
    send the task (r_y, p(r_x)) to owner(r_y)
```

### Messages
During the distributed phase, process can exchange two kind of messages.

#### Task
Ask to take controll of a find-union operation.
 - **(x, y)**: the original edge we want to insert
 - **r_x**: a local vertex
 - **r_y**: an arbitrary vertex
Thus *16 bytes* of data to send if 32 bits integers are used.

Toward a proof
--------------
It seems that a correctness proof of this algorithm can easily be done by checking theses two rules at any step of the algorithm:
 1. The union of process's forests is a forest.
 2. The union of process's forests union the set of edges we are propagating has the same accessibility relation as the original graph.

Note that when there is no more edges to check, theses two rules are exactly checking that the union of process's forests is a spanning forest of the original graph.
