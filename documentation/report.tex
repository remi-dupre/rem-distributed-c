    % Some bullshit is expected here I guess ?
    % Goal of the internship (maybe quickly as not everything is supposed to be introduced)

    % Give any information about what isn't my work

      \subsubsection{Disjoint set structure}
        % Definition of a disjoint set structure
        The disjoint set structure is a very classical structure that represents a partition of a finite set $X = \biguplus\limits_{i \in I} S_i$. It is meant to allow two fast queries:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item $\Call{Union}{a, b}$: alter the structure to merge the set $a$ belongs to and the set $b$ belongs to. After such an operation, $\exists! i \in I~/~a \in S_i \land b \in S_i$.
          \item $\Call{find}{a}$: give a unique representative of the set $a$ belongs to. It means that $\forall a, b \in X,~\Call{find}{a} = \Call{find}{b} \Leftrightarrow \exists! i \in I~/~a \in S_i \land b \in S_i$.
        \end{itemize}
        In practice, it is usually represented by a forest of the elements of $X$, $\textsc{union}$ merges two trees and $\textsc{find}$ returns the root of a tree given one of its nodes.
        In a program, such a forest is represented by an array of size $|X|$, assuming that $X = \llbracket 0, |X|-1 \rrbracket$, the element of index $a$ will be $b$ if b is the parent of $a$ in a tree, or $a$ if $a$ is a root.
